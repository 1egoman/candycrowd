Candy Crowd
===

When trick-or-treaking, track which houses are handing out full size candybars
and which are handing out toothbrushes. And, let other would-be
trick-or-treaters know where to get the good :candy:.

Also, looking to have:
- Overlayed map displaying all local dwellings
- Ratings displayed right on top of the map for each location (<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/event-simple>)
- Mobile app

Will be working on this during fall Hack Upstate 2015.

<!-- // To add the marker to the map, call setMap();
     marker.setMap(map);
-->
